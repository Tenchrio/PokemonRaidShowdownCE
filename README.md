# Pokemon Raid Shodown Chrome Extension

This is the code for a chrome extension that sets things up in Pokemon Showdown.
A small dropdown is added to the site under the left Pokemon Field, in there you can select from Raid level 4 to 7.
When a selection is made it will automatically set the level, clear the EVs and Item box and enable the Tera Type checkbox (as well as submit so the values change for the calculator).
Under the damage calc there also appears text with the percentage needed to 1 shot that specific level of Tera Raid.
